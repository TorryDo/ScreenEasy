## I. Install  <a name="install"/>
<details> <summary> Ensure your app‚Äôs minimum SDK version is 21+ and `mavenCentral()` included</summary>
</br>
1. Ensure your app‚Äôs minimum SDK version is 21+. This is declared in the module-level `build.gradle` file 

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdk 21
    }
```

2. Ensure the `mavenCentral()` repository is declared in the project-level `build.gradle` or `setting.gradle` file:

    <details><summary>build.gradle (project-level)</summary>

    ```gradle
        allprojects {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
    ```

    </details>


    <details><summary>Alternative (In case "allprojects" not found). go to settings.gradle</summary>

    ```gradle
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            ...
            mavenCentral()
        }
    }
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        ...
        repositories {
            ...
            mavenCentral()
        }
